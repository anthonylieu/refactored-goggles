## usage

my app was made with these things in mind it need to look neat for the user simple and easy to understand. i made this with 3 screens one for a homepage one to search for a item and bring up the item with a small picture a description and price then i used the product id to bring up a screen with a more indepth look and the item use a small amount of styling to make the items look pleasing to the eye. finally add the screen to take advange of the user devices location and bring up near by deals.

## challanges

some of the limitations used when making this app where time i work a full time job and at the time of making am enrolled in the full stack developer progrom provided by Uncc. this will be the second time using react native so learning all the new types of things i can do with this language is amazing and felt great. the last limitation was not haveing a mac at the time and only being able to use one for aout 7 hours from a friend so having one day to learn and build was stressfull but also fulfilling.
